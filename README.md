# GDIM32 In Class Activities
## Week 1
### Activity 1
- Making sure your itch page is actually published.
- Start your minigame earlier instead of two days before the deadline
- Make sure to finish all minigames or code because you can use previous code to help with future assignments instead of rewriting completely new code. 

### Activity 2 
- 10
- 2
- These lines of code prints the message "hello world" every frame.  
- Monobehavior
- These lines of code prints the message x = 10 upon the start of the game. 
- The 10 highlighted is an argument and the second highlighted part is a parameter. The purpose of it is to call upon the argument and pass it through the method.  
- The Translate is calling upon the class
- The Translate should call upon the _playerTransform instead.

I created a coin prefab, created a ground for the penguin sprite to be on, and put colliders on both the penguin and ground so that the penguin won't fall through the map. I also set up 
the outline of three scripts, PenguinPlayer, GameController, and coin with comments about what attributes and actions the GameObject needs.

### Activity 1 
When we added multiple Locator objects in the Scene and ran the game, only one of the Locator objects had the locator script. 
This is because in the Locator script, we wrote code to ensure that the Locator object doesn't repeat twice and that if it does, it
is destroyed.

### Activity 3
